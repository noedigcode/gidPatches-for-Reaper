gidPatches for Reaper

Switch patches for live keyboard playing using Reaper.

Features:
 - Pretty little GUI lists patches and indicates current patch.
 - Instant patch switching.
 - Notes, sustain pedal and pitchbend which are held during patch change are held until
   released, i.e. no sudden noteoffs when changing patches and no stuck notes, sustain
   pedal or pitchbend.
 - Reaper tracks represent patches and are automatically detected by the GUI. Tracks can
   be ignored by starting the name with an underscore.

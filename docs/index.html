<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
gidPatches allows you to instantly switch between patches for live playing using MIDI program messages. Reaper tracks represent patches (but tracks starting with an underscore are ignored). A JSFX plugin on a main MIDI distribute track routes MIDI to channels based on the current patch. The patch tracks are automatically detected by a GUI Lua script which also automatically creates sends from the main distribute track to the patch tracks using the appropriate MIDI channels.
</p>

<p>
The JSFX which does the MIDI routing ensures seamless patch switching. When notes, sustain pedal or pitchbend are held during a patch change, it is held until the user releases it. This ensures there are no sudden note-offs when changing patches and no stuck notes, sustain pedal or pitchbend.
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<ol>
<li> Create a track for each patch. Any tracks to be excluded from the patch list should start with an underscore.
<li> Create a track named "_Distribute Midi".
<li> Ensure "_Distrbute Midi" receives all the MIDI you want routed to the patches, as well as program changes that will switch patches. Also make sure monitoring is enabled (right-click on the track's record button) and that the track is armed for recording.
<li> Ensure "_Distribute Midi" also receives the Reaper virtual keyboard MIDI as this is used to send MIDI from the GUI script.
<li> Add the "GVDK MIDI Patches" JSFX effect to the "_Distribute Midi" effects chain. This script routes incomming MIDI to MIDI channels based on program changes received. It also emits a CC message when a patch is changed.
<li> Also add the "MIDItoReaControlPath" VST to the effects chain, after the previous effect. This will receive the CC messages when a patch is changed and eventually send it to our GUI.
<li> In the Reaper Actions editor, load the "gidPatchesMain.lua" and "gidPatchesChange.lua" scripts.
<li> Assign a shortcut to the "gidPatchesChange.lua" script. Send a program change to the "_Distribute Midi" track. The shortcut assignment dialog should detect a CC message with a value corresponding to a program change. Finalise the shortcut assignment.
<li> Run the "gidPatchesMain.lua" script. This opens a GUI. The GUI automatically detects the patch tracks and automatically removes all the sends of "_Distribute Midi", and creates new sends to all the patch tracks. Each send uses a different MIDI channel.
</ol>

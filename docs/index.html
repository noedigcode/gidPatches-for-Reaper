<p>
gidPatches allows you to instantly switch between patches for live playing using MIDI program messages. Reaper tracks represent patches (but tracks starting with an underscore are ignored). A JSFX plugin on a main MIDI distribute track routes MIDI to channels based on the current patch. The patch tracks are automatically detected by a GUI Lua script which also automatically creates sends from the main distribute track to the patch tracks using the appropriate MIDI channels.
</p>

<p>
The JSFX which does the MIDI routing ensures seamless patch switching. When notes, sustain pedal or pitchbend are held during a patch change, it is held until the user releases it. This ensures there are no sudden note-offs when changing patches and no stuck notes, sustain pedal or pitchbend.
